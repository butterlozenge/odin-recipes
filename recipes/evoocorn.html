    <h3>EVOO corn</h3>
    <p>Yes, this is popcorn. But not just <em>any</em> popcorn; it's EVOO corn. This small change makes a huge difference in flavor. I encourage you to give
    it a try over your normal buttered popcorn.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp of oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of popcorn kernels</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of the best EVOO you can find</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a tall pot (the kernels will fly)</li>
        <li>Once oil is up to temp, add enough kernels to cover the bottom of the pot</li>
        <li>Keep lid partially on while kernels pop</li>
        <li>Shake every so often to ensure popped kernels won't stick to the bottom of the pot and burn</li>
        <li>Transfer popcorn to a large bowl and drizzle with EVOO</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
